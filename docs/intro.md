# Simple Data Provider

This project is intended to help with a simple concept of passing data from one location to another.

This little helper project aims to aid you in making good choices for your data needs, whether that be fetching pages
of data, massaging data, or simply passing rows of data with a uniform access strategy.

Let's take a look at what this will do for you!

The Data provider will provide a uniform interface for handling data in a list or data provided from methods or
generators.
