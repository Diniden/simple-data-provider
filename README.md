## Developing

This project is a simple method library. So it's more appropriate to develop using the unit-tests rather than a browser

```sh
npm run unit-test-dev
```

If you wish to test the bundling procedure and execute the methods in a browser, simply use:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then follow the instructions in the browser after opening the webpage.
